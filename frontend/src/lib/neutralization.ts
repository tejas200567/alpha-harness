 * BRAIN's neutralizations, in the two families its own documentation splits them into.

 * crowding factors, and the fundamental factor models — "In BRAIN Research, fundamental models
 * such as SLOW, FAST, and SLOW_AND_FAST are already represented"
 * (`docs/learn/advanced-topics/getting-started-statistical-risk-neutralized-alphas`). Everything
 * else neutralizes against a group of instruments, or against nothing at all.
 *
 * Which of them a market actually offers is BRAIN's to say, so the groups here are only an
 * ordering: a picker intersects them with the legal values for the scope it is showing.
