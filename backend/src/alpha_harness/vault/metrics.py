"""BRAIN's performance figures, rebuilt from an alpha's ``pnl`` and ``turnover`` recordsets.

Measured against 36 alphas across nine regions; each figure matches the platform's to the
decimals it shows, apart from $1 PnL differences that come from the recordsets being rounded.
What that measurement settled, where it departs from the documentation:

- A year is **250** days, not the documented 252, for both Sharpe and returns.
- Daily PnL is the difference of the cumulative ``pnl`` recordset. The ``daily-pnl`` recordset
  is rounded separately and drifts from the platform's own figures.
- Each ``turnover`` row is stamped one trading day early. The day the book is first built
  trades it whole (1.0) and can fall off that shift, and a gap in the series after trading
  began is the book being sold whole (1.0 again).
- Drawdown's running peak starts at the first day's cumulative PnL, not at zero.
- Fitness is computed from the Sharpe as displayed, rounded to two places.

- BRAIN's IS and test blocks include final days no recordset carries (see
  :func:`closing_days`). The yearly rows leave them out.
- For some Alphas the turnover recordset is not the turnover BRAIN's figures use; its yearly
  figures are, so turnover is scaled to them (see :func:`calibrate`).
