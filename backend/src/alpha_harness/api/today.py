"""Today: what you have, and what you are about to waste.

One endpoint behind the first screen a consultant sees: simulations left today, what the
account can do, and what is left in the assistant's budget. It also drives the onboarding
flow, which is linear on purpose — sign in, add a key, start.

The true daily simulation limit reaches us only in the response headers of a simulation
POST, so the figure starts as the configured allowance minus today's runs and is replaced
by the platform's own number once the first batch comes back. ``exact`` says which one you
are looking at.
