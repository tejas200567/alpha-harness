"""Sealing secrets at rest.

Secrets (the BRAIN password, Google API keys) are sealed with AES-256-GCM and stored as
opaque blobs in SQLite. The key lives in a single file created ``0600`` under the data
directory.

Threat model: this protects against casual disclosure — a stray backup, an accidental
`git add`, someone reading the database file — but **not** against an attacker who already
has your user account, since the key is readable by it. That is the deliberate trade for a
tool that must resume polling unattended after a restart without prompting for a passphrase.
