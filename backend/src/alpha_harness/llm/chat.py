"""A conversation with the assistant, and the field picks that come out of it.

Anything a consultant types steers the search, so the assistant's job here is narrow: read
the hunch, and come back with **actual data fields** to run on. The conversation is the
input; a field list is the output; the labs take it from there.

Two controls:

* **Model.** The daily budget varies twenty-five-fold across the roster, and running out
  is the thing that ends a session. See :mod:`.registry`.
* **Reasoning.** Thinking tokens are billed against the same per-minute budget as the
  answer, so "think harder" is a real cost rather than a free upgrade.

History lives in the database so a conversation survives a restart.
