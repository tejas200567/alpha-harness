"""Calling the model.

Every call goes through :meth:`LLMService.generate`, which does the same four things in
the same order: pick a key with budget, send, record what it actually cost, and — when
Google disagrees with our accounting — mark that pair spent and try the next key rather
than retrying into the same wall.

Rotation chooses by remaining daily budget and believes a ``429`` immediately, because a
retry loop that tries each key in turn burns a request from every key on a bad day.
