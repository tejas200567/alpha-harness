"""Which assistants can answer, and how to get a key for each.

Every provider here has a **free tier that needs no card**. That is the whole selection
rule: the assistant is optional, so a provider that asks for payment details first turns an
optional convenience into a purchase decision.

All of them except Google speak the OpenAI chat-completions protocol, which is why one
small client in :mod:`.openai_compat` serves seven of them. Google keeps its own path
because ``google-genai`` gives structured output and thinking levels that the
chat-completions shape cannot express.

**A key only ever answers for its own provider**, so rotation filters on provider before it
looks at budget.

**The limits below are transcribed, not measured**, read off documentation pages and kept
deliberately conservative: a budget guessed high spends someone's day before anyone notices
it was wrong, and a budget guessed low only costs a rotation.
