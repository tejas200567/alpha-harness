"""Which models exist, and what each one costs you.

Three limits apply at once on the AI Studio free tier, and they are not equally
important:

* **RPM** — requests per minute. Recovers in sixty seconds; briefly annoying.
* **TPM** — tokens per minute. Also recovers in sixty seconds.
* **RPD** — requests per day. **This is the one that ends your session.** It does not
  recover until midnight Pacific, and it varies by a factor of twenty-five across the
  roster: twenty a day on Gemini 3.8 Flash, five hundred on 3.5 Flash Lite.

That last point drives the design: every model carries its daily budget where it is chosen,
the Lite models are marked for bulk work, and someone who picks the newest model because it
sounds best does not get twenty questions and then silence.

**Nothing here is authoritative except as a starting point.** Google publishes no endpoint
for free-tier quotas, so the numbers below are transcribed and *will* drift; correcting one
is a one-line edit here.
