"""Async SQLAlchemy engine, session factory, and the additive schema migration.

WAL mode plus a busy timeout: the background simulation tracker writes while HTTP
handlers read, and SQLite's default rollback journal would make them block each other.

``create_all`` only creates missing *tables*, so a column added to a model after the
database was created never appears and surfaces much later as ``no such column``.
:func:`migrate` closes that gap on every startup by comparing the live schema against
``Base.metadata``.

**Additive, with two exceptions.** A column that has *disappeared* from a model is reported
rather than quietly reconciled, unless it is listed in :data:`RETIRED`, or left ``NOT NULL``
with no default: nothing writes that one, so it blocks every insert into its table, and it
is dropped because nothing reads it either.
