"""The batch engine: queue, pack, submit, expand.

Throughput on BRAIN is eight *concurrent simulations*, each of which may be a
multi-simulation carrying up to ten children — so eighty at once, but only when the work
packs, since children of one batch must share a 5-tuple (see :mod:`.packer`).

This module owns the queue, the slot accounting, and reading a batch's children to
completion; :mod:`.packer` decides what to send, :mod:`.lifecycle` owns the atomic write
of a platform id, and :class:`~alpha_harness.engine.tracker.SimulationTracker` polls the
parent until it lists its children.
