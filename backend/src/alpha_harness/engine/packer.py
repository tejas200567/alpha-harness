"""Packing simulations into multi-simulation batches.

``POST /simulations`` accepts an array of 2-10 simulation objects, but every child of one
batch must agree on ``type``, ``instrumentType``, ``region``, ``delay`` and ``language``;
universe, neutralization, decay, truncation and expression may differ (see
``docs/wqb-documentation/consultant-information/multi-alpha-simulation.md``).

That constraint is the whole reason this module exists: throughput is not "80 at a time"
but "8 batches of up to 10 that happen to share a 5-tuple", so a sweep varying region or
delay fragments into small batches while one varying universe and expression packs
perfectly. Pure by design — no database, no HTTP.
