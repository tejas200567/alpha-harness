"""Keep the machine awake while simulations are pending.

The daily allowance completes over hours, a sleeping machine sends nothing, and quota
unspent by the US-Eastern reset is gone — so while work is pending the OS is asked, with
its own tool, not to sleep. Lid-close sleep is not preventable by these APIs and WSL
cannot reach the Windows host; the Matrix tells the user instead.
