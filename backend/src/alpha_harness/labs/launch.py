"""From a lab's form to a task in Tasks: what the account and market allow, and the Study row.

Every lab router asks the same questions — which operators the account has, which universes
and neutralizations BRAIN allows, whether the market is downloaded — so the answers live
here and the four labs cannot drift apart on them.

Nothing here raises HTTP errors: a problem is returned as a sentence, and the router
decides whether it blocks.
