"""Evolution Lab: breed new Alphas from seed Alphas, scored on the train years only.

A hybrid of the research notes' gene GA and tree GP, because seeds are arbitrary expressions:

* **Genes** are what a mutation may change without changing the shape: an operator for a
  peer taking the same inputs, a lookback for a neighbouring economic window, a field for
  another in its dataset, a group for another group, and the neutralization and decay.
* **Crossover** is uniform, gene by gene, when two parents share a shape; otherwise a call
  of one is grafted into the other, never growing past the larger parent.

Every child is simulated holding the last two years out as a test and scored on Fitness
over the first eight, which BRAIN reports in the ``train`` block. Parents are the best of
everything scored so far, kept apart by the correlation of their daily PnL over the train
years.
