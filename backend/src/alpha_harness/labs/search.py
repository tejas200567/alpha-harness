"""Search Lab: first- and second-degree Alphas over chosen datasets, searched for Sharpe.

Every field is cleaned with ``ts_backfill(field, 21)`` first. That is data cleaning, not a
degree, and neither is the vector operator a VECTOR field needs before any other operator
can read it. On that base ``B`` the lab writes six shapes:

    cs(B)    ts(B, d)    group(B, g)    cs(ts(B, d))    ts(ts(B, d), d)    group(ts(B, d), g)

A run is a single-objective TPE study asked define-by-run, because the space is
conditional: a lookback exists only where a time-series operator does, a vector operator
only for a vector field, and a field only in a universe that has it. The first pass gives
every field one trial, budget permitting; after that the sampler concentrates on what
scores.
