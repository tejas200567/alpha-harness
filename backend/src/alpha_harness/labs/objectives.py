"""What a study is trying to maximise, and what it must not violate.

Two different things come out of a finished alpha:

**Objectives** are the numbers being optimised — Sharpe, fitness, train fitness.
They come from the in-sample statistics block.

**Constraints** are the submission checks, read from the response rather than written down
here because the limits differ by region and delay.

The encoding follows Optuna's convention — at or below zero is feasible, and the magnitude
says by how much — so a sampler that understands constraints prefers a nearly-passing alpha
over a badly-failing one.
