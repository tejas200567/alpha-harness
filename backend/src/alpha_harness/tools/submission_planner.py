"""Submission Planner: which submittable Alphas to submit, and in what order.

BRAIN refuses a Power Pool Alpha whose PnL correlation against one already submitted reaches
0.5, and a submission is permanent. So the question is not "which Alpha is best" but which
*set* is best. The method, in full:

1. Line every Alpha's daily PnL up by date, and divide each series by its own volatility, so
   one Alpha cannot dominate the search just by trading larger. That is a search prior, not a
   book: every figure reported comes off the plain sum, which is what a submitted Alpha
   actually trades.
2. A portfolio is legal when every pair inside it correlates below 0.5.
3. Split history in four-fifths and one-fifth. On the first four-fifths, search for the legal
   portfolio with the best combined Sharpe at each size.
4. Combined Sharpe rises with size, peaks, then falls: past the peak each extra Alpha adds
   more redundancy than return. **The peak is the number to submit.**
5. Score that portfolio on the final fifth, which the search never saw. That is the honest
   estimate of what it will do next.
6. Re-run the search over the whole history and take that many Alphas. The split chose the
   size; the full history chooses the members.

Only step 4 is a decision, and it is made on the window the search can actually resolve --
one-fifth of ten years is about 500 days, over which the standard error of a Sharpe ratio is
about 0.7 (``sqrt((252 + S**2 / 2) / N)``, Lo 2002, confirmed by simulation). Adjacent sizes
differ by a tenth or two, so that window cannot rank them. The last fifth reports; it does not
choose.
