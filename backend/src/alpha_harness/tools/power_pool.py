"""Power Pool Correlation, measured locally against your own submitted Power Pool Alphas.

BRAIN answers this one Alpha at a time, slowly and under a rate limit, so a sweep of a
thousand results cannot be judged by asking it. The same number can be worked out here: the
correlation is Pearson over daily PnL on the days both Alphas traded, over BRAIN's own
window, which :mod:`tools.submission_planner` already reproduces to four decimals.

Which Alphas this applies to is BRAIN's own call, read off its ``POWER_POOL_CORRELATION``
check (``vault.yields.is_power_pool``). Two rules then decide eligibility, both from
``docs/learn/consultant-information/getting-started-power-pool-alphas``:

- Power Pool Correlation must be below the planner's :data:`CEILING`.
- Above it, the Alpha needs a Sharpe at least :data:`ESCAPE` times that of **every**
  Alpha it collides with — not merely the one it correlates with most.

That second rule is stricter than the platform's own wording, which says "10% higher than the
most correlated Alpha". Measured: ``omLgk09k``, Sharpe 2.43, correlated 0.627 with a Sharpe
1.70 Alpha and 0.5541 with a Sharpe 2.62 one. The documented rule sets the bar at 1.87 and
admits it; BRAIN refused it, which only the 2.88 bar from the second collision explains.

Scope is the region, and only the region. Measured against BRAIN's own endpoint: a TOP3000
candidate is correlated against TOP500 and TOP2000 members alike, and a USA **D0** candidate
against the USA D1 pool. Delay and universe are not part of the bucket.
