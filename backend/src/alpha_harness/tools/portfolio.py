"""The Portfolio page: submitted Alphas combined at equal weight.

Equal weight is what BRAIN itself does. Its own pool figure (``before-and-after-performance``)
is the mean of the members' cumulative PnL, to within half a dollar a day, with turnover the
plain mean of theirs, measured. Filtered to one region and delay, this reproduces it.

Across regions the calendars differ, so the headline puts every Alpha on the union of their
trading days, counting a day an Alpha did not trade as zero: once it has started, each Alpha
keeps an equal share of capital whether or not its market was open.
