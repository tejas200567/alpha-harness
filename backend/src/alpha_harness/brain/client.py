"""Async HTTP client for the BRAIN API.

Two behaviours in here are the reason this file exists, and both break naive clients:

1. **A response carrying ``Retry-After`` means "not ready yet".** The header's presence —
   not the status code — is the signal (``docs/wqb-api/03-conventions.md``).
   :meth:`BrainClient.poll` re-issues the request until it is gone; recordsets,
   correlations and checks are read that way.
2. **``POST /simulations`` answers in headers.** The id is in ``Location``; the caller
   reads it from :class:`BrainResponse`.

Versioning lives in the ``Accept`` header (``application/json;version=N``), not the path.
