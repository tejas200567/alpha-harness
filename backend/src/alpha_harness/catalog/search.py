"""Finding a Data Field by meaning rather than by substring.

BRAIN's field ids are compressed jargon — ``anl44_eps_prevalue``, ``mdl50_bk_analyst_revisn``
— but their descriptions are plain English, and a BM25 index over the id's own words *and*
the description finds a field from the words a person would actually use. Nothing is
translated or guessed at on the way in: the id is split where BRAIN put a separator, and the
description is taken as written.

One row per field id rather than per market: the text is identical across markets, and BM25's
term statistics are better drawn from the whole catalog than from one slice. Narrowing to a
market stays the caller's job.
