"""Download the BRAIN data catalog into DuckDB.

Scope is one ``(instrumentType, region, delay, universe)`` tuple per run, because that is
exactly how the platform scopes ``/data-fields`` — a field that exists in USA/delay-1
may simply not exist in EUR/delay-0. Storing one row per field *per tuple* is what makes
"which fields are in both delays" a single query later.

``GET /data-fields`` at ``version=3.0`` with all four scope parameters returns a whole
scope in one response (``docs/wqb-api/endpoints/data.md``). Datasets are paged;
categories are one request and do not depend on the scope.
