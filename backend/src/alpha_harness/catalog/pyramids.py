"""Pyramids: a dataset category in one region and delay.

BRAIN pays a multiplier per pyramid and counts one as formulated once three Alphas are
submitted in it in a quarter. Both numbers come from the account's activity endpoints;
whether a pyramid can be researched here comes from the downloaded fields. BRAIN exposes
no quarter dates, and Genius levels run on calendar quarters, so the quarter is derived
from today's date in platform time.
