"""Alpha Harness on Windows: keep a Python and a venv, run the app, apply updates.

Frozen with PyInstaller into ``AlphaHarness.exe``. It carries ``uv.exe`` and nothing else —
the app's own dependencies are a third of a gigabyte, and a user who updates weekly should
not re-download ``pyarrow`` every week. So the heavy half is installed once into
``%LOCALAPPDATA%\\AlphaHarness`` and an update is just this project's wheel, a few megabytes.

The launcher is the *parent* of the app, which is what makes updating safe. Windows keeps a
running process's extension modules open, so an install that replaces ``duckdb`` under a live
app fails half-way. Here the app writes the version it wants and exits; the install happens
with nothing running; then the app starts again.

Deliberately standard library only: it is frozen separately from the app and must keep
working when the venv it manages does not.
